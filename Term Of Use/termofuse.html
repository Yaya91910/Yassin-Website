    <h2><u>Governing Law; Dispute Resolution</u></h2>
    <p>You agree that all matters relating to your access to or use of the Site, including all disputes, will be governed by the laws of the United States and by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflicts of laws provisions.
      You agree to the personal jurisdiction by and venue in the state and federal courts in Santa Clara County, California, and waive any objection to such jurisdiction or venue. The preceding provision regarding venue does not apply if you are a
      consumer based in the European Union. If you are a consumer based in the European Union, you may make a claim in the courts of the country where you reside. Any claim under these Terms of Use must be brought within one (1) year after the cause
      of action arises, or such claim or cause of action is barred. Claims made under the separate terms and conditions of purchase for goods and services are not subject to this limitation. No recovery may be sought or received for damages other
      than out-of-pocket expenses, except that the prevailing party will be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees. In the event of any controversy or dispute between Apple and you arising out of or in connection with your use of the Site, the parties
      shall attempt, promptly and in good faith, to resolve any such dispute. If we are unable to resolve any such dispute within a reasonable time (not to exceed thirty (30) days), then either party may submit such controversy or dispute to
      mediation. If the dispute cannot be resolved through mediation, then the parties shall be free to pursue any right or remedy available to them under applicable law.</p>

    <h2><u>Void Where Prohibited</u></h2>
    <p>Apple administers and operates the www.apple.com Site from its location in Cupertino, California USA; other Apple sites may be administered and operated from various locations outside the United States. Although the Site is accessible
      worldwide, not all features, products or services discussed, referenced, provided or offered through or on the Site are available to all persons or in all geographic locations, or appropriate or available for use outside the United States.
      Apple reserves the right to limit, in its sole discretion, the provision and quantity of any feature, product or service to any person or geographic area. Any offer for any feature, product or service made on the Site is void where prohibited.
      If you choose to access the Site from outside the United States, you do so on your own initiative and you are solely responsible for complying with applicable local laws.</p>

    <h2><u>Miscellaneous </u></h2>
    <p>You may not use or export or re-export any Content or any copy or adaptation of such Content, or any product or service offered on the Site, in violation of any applicable laws or regulations, including without limitation United States export
      laws and regulations.</p>

    <p>If any of the provisions of these Terms of Use are held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be void or unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary and replaced with a
      valid provision that best embodies the intent of these Terms of Use, so that these Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Apple with regard to your use of the Site,
      and any and all other written or oral agreements or understandings previously existing between you and Apple with respect to such use are hereby superseded and cancelled. Other than as provided in a purchase agreement you enter into with Apple,
      Apple will not accept any counter-offers to these Terms of Use, and all such offers are hereby categorically rejected. Apple’s failure to insist on or enforce strict performance of these Terms of Use shall not be construed as a waiver by Apple
      of any provision or any right it has to enforce these Terms of Use, nor shall any course of conduct between Apple and you or any other party be deemed to modify any provision of these Terms of Use. These Terms of Use shall not be interpreted or
      construed to confer any rights or remedies on any third parties.</p>

    <p>Apple provides access to Apple international data and, therefore, may contain references or cross references to Apple products, programs and services that are not announced in your country. Such reference does not imply that Apple in your
      country intends to announce such products, programs or services.</p>

    <h2><u>Feedback and Information</u></h2>
    <p>Any feedback you provide at this site shall be deemed to be non-confidential. Apple shall be free to use such information on an unrestricted basis.</p>
